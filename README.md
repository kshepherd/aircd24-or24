## Other notes

* Peter Sefton [wrote a blog post](https://ptsefton.com/2024/06/26/open-repositories-2024-trip/) (from which I stole photos teehee) with a much better rundown than my 8 minute ramble
* The conference hashtag was #openrepos2024 but with the fall of twitter, it was a bit sparse and spread out over platforms (Mastodon probably most popular)
